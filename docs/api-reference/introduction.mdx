QFEX provides a unified interface for trading and market data via **two** protocols:

- **gRPC**: High performance, strongly typed, HTTP/2 binary protocol. Like JSON, but faster and safer.
- **WebSocket**: Wider compatibility with legacy systems as well as web support.

Choose the protocol that best fits your integration needs.

## Authentication & API Keys

All API calls must be authenticated with an **API Key**. You can create and manage your keys from your QFEX dashboard:

1. Sign in at [app.qfex.com](https://app.qfex.com).
2. Navigate to **Account** → **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create New API Key**, provide a descriptive name, and confirm.
4. **Copy** the generated key and store it securely — it will only be shown once.

### Navigate to API Keys in your Account Menu

Include your key in every request:

- **gRPC**: Add an `api-key` metadata field.

```http
(api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE)
```

- **WebSocket**: Add an `id` parameter to the request.

```http
id: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
